What problem are you trying to solve?
- Idk, people sometimes like to categorize what they listen to, and I'd like to make a listening history search engine where you can search by genre
Who is the audience?
- people with Spotify accounts?
- people who like categorizing their music

How will the project requirements be fufilled?
- 4 routes: base route, genre details, song details, search results
- GET listening history, POST what you think your favorite genre is PUT/PATCH what that genre is, DELETE that genre  
- Search loading animation
- form validation: test the search fields 

Which addon(s) do you think you will use and for what?
- Spotify API
- ember-burger-menu
